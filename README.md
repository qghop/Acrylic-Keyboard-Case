## Design Goals + Improvements

Central goal to create a custom, economic keyboard case for the Mode Envoy PCB and Plate, which I acquired from a friend.

Acryllic was chosen early for cost and ease of manufacturing. Other acryllic cases for mechanical keyboards utilized many stacked layers and inlaying the keyboard, which I decided to avoid due to cost and disliking the style.

V1 accounted for the separated USB-C connection daughter board by adding a full sized second plate, which resulted in an uncomfortable typing experience due to a lack of an angle and a platform too high.

V2 fixed both these issues by drastically shortening the bottom plate. This gives a typing angle of about 5 degrees, and a much shorter front.
